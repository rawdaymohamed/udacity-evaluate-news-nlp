# Udacity Evaluate News NLP

- This is the 4th project of the Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.

- This main idea is to get information about the tone of an article such as: whether it's positive or negative (polarity) and whether it's subjective (opinion) or objective (fact based)

- You need to add the article `url` in the form

## Setting the API

This project uses the meaning cloud API.
